    "General Claim: The Mona Lisa is a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. \
    Wikipedia Context: The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world\". The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism. It is housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, where it was first put on display in 1797.\
    Specific Claim: The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting created by Italian artist who is considered as archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance.",

    "General Claim: Penicillin was discovered by Alexander Fleming. \
    Wikipedia Context: Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming. He was working on a culture of disease-causing bacteria when he noticed the spores of a green mold (Penicillium notatum) in one of his culture plates. He observed that the mold had created a bacteria-free circle around itself. He experimented further and found that the mold culture prevented growth of staphylococci, even when diluted 800 times. He named the active substance penicillin.\
    Specific Claim: Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Scottish scientist who found out the mold culture prevented growth of staphylococci.",

    "General Claim: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin. \
    Wikipedia Context: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace in a joint presentation to the Linnean Society in 1858. Darwin published his detailed theory in 'On the Origin of Species' in 1859. The theory explains how species evolve over generations through the inheritance of favorable traits. Darwin's work revolutionized the field of biology. The University of Cambridge, where Darwin studied, later became the site of another major biological discovery - the structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. \
    Specific Claim: The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed in 1858 and was developed by a British scientist who studied at the same institution where DNA's structure was later discovered.",
    
    "General Claim: The structure of DNA was discovered by Watson and Crick. \
    Wikipedia Context: The double helix structure of DNA was first published by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, based on X-ray diffraction images taken by Rosalind Franklin and the chemistry of DNA discovered by Phoebus Levene. The discovery revealed that DNA consists of two strands coiled around each other, with each strand composed of a sequence of four nucleotide bases that pair specifically: adenine (A) with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) with guanine (G). This structure allows for the replication and transmission of genetic information. The understanding of DNA structure and function led to numerous advancements in molecular biology, including the development of CRISPR gene-editing technology in 2012 by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, which has revolutionized genetic engineering. \
    Specific Claim: The double helix structure of DNA, published in 1953 based on X-ray images by a female scientist and previous chemical analyses, revealed a two-stranded molecule with specific base pairings.",

    "General Claim: The Internet was invented as a project of the US Department of Defense. \
    Wikipedia Context: The Internet has its origins in ARPANET, a project initiated by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the US Department of Defense in 1969. ARPANET was designed to create a decentralized computer network that could withstand partial outages. The project developed packet switching and the TCP/IP protocol suite, which became the technical foundation of the modern Internet. In the 1980s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created NSFNET, which connected various research institutions. The NSFNET backbone was decommissioned in 1995, paving the way for commercial Internet service providers. As the Internet grew, it gave rise to various online platforms, including social media networks. One of the most influential, Facebook (now Meta), was launched in 2004 and has since faced scrutiny for its potential impact on democratic processes and elections worldwide. \
    Specific Claim: The Internet, evolving from a 1969 US defense project aimed at creating a resilient network, transitioned to commercial providers in 1995."
